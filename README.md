# MASM-Low-Level-I-O-Procedures
Portfolio Project
Description: A portfolio assignment for OSU CS 271
A homemade version of ReadVal and WriteVal procedures for signed integers. 
Uses macros for displaying strings and getting the user's information.  
It is a small test program that requests 10 integers with validation from the user.
Converts those values, and  stores the numeric values in an array.  
The program then displays the integers, their sum, and their average.
It can handle positive and negative values that fit inside a 32-bit register.
